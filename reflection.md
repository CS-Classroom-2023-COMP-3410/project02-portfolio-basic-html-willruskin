This was a fun project. I had a good time creating all the pages. I ran into some difficulty with the tables and how to get the content columns and rows to actually look correct. Took a lot of rereading the code to get it. Originally I was gonna do a portfolio on myself but it seemed like more fun to do Batman. Big fan of the guy. It was a bit of hassle to do all the accessibility as well.
